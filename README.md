# Project Setup

All features will not be available in this link: [Project Demo](https://mr12c.github.io/KTG-TASK-2/).

For a fully functional version of the project, it's better to fork the repository and run it locally.

## Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Fork the Repository**:
    - Go to the repository you want to fork.
    - Click on the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/KTG-TASK-2.git
    ```
    Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```sh
    cd KTG-TASK-2
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

5. **Run the Project**:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

The project should now be running locally on your machine.

## Notes
- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the repository's documentation or open an issue in the repository.

Enjoy working with the project!
